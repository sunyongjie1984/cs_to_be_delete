              <h2>Guidelines</h2>

              <h3>When should I use exceptions?</h3>

              <p>The simple answer is: ``whenever the semantic and
              performance characteristics of exceptions are
              appropriate.''</p>

              <p>An oft-cited guideline is to ask yourself the question ``is
              this an exceptional (or unexpected) situation?'' This guideline
              has an attractive ring to it, but is usually a mistake. The
              problem is that one person's ``exceptional'' is another's
              ``expected'': when you really look at the terms carefully, the
              distinction evaporates and you're left with no guideline. After
              all, if you check for an error condition, then in some sense
              you expect it to happen, or the check is wasted code.</p>

              <p>A more appropriate question to ask is: ``do we want stack
              unwinding here?'' Because actually handling an exception is
              likely to be significantly slower than executing mainline code,
              you should also ask: ``Can I afford stack unwinding here?'' For
              example, a desktop application performing a long computation
              might periodically check to see whether the user had pressed a
              cancel button. Throwing an exception could allow the operation
              to be cancelled gracefully. On the other hand, it would
              probably be inappropriate to throw and <i>handle</i> exceptions
              in the inner loop of this computation because that could have a
              significant performance impact. The guideline mentioned above
              has a grain of truth in it: in time critical code, throwing an
              exception should <em>be</em> the exception, not the rule.</p>

              <h3>How should I design my exception classes?</h3>

              <ol>
                <li><strong>Derive your exception class from
                <code>std::exception</code></strong>. Except in *very* rare
                circumstances where you can't afford the cost of a virtual
                table, <code>std::exception</code> makes a reasonable
                exception base class, and when used universally, allows
                programmers to catch "everything" without resorting to
                <code>catch(...)</code>. For more about
                <code>catch(...)</code>, see below.</li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Use <i>virtual</i> inheritance.</strong> This
                  insight is due to Andrew Koenig. Using virtual inheritance
                  from your exception's base class(es) prevents ambiguity
                  problems at the catch-site in case someone throws an
                  exception derived from multiple bases which have a base
                  class in common:
                  <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
struct my_exc1 : std::exception { char const* what() const throw(); };
struct my_exc2 : std::exception { char const* what() const throw(); };
struct your_exc3 : my_exc1, my_exc2 {};

int main()
{
   try { throw your_exc3(); }
   catch(std::exception const&amp; e) {}
   catch(...) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "whoops!" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
}
</pre>The program above prints <code>"whoops"</code> because the C++ runtime
can't resolve which <code>exception</code> instance to match in the first
catch clause.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong><i>Don't</i> embed a std::string object</strong> or
                  any other data member or base class whose copy constructor
                  could throw an exception. That could lead directly to
                  std::terminate() at the throw point. Similarly, it's a bad
                  idea to use a base or member whose ordinary constructor(s)
                  might throw, because, though not necessarily fatal to your
                  program, you may report a different exception than intended
                  from a <i>throw-expression</i> that includes construction
                  such as:
                  <pre>throw some_exception();    
</pre>

                  <p>There are various ways to avoid copying string objects
                  when exceptions are copied, including embedding a
                  fixed-length buffer in the exception object, or managing
                  strings via reference-counting. However, consider the next
                  point before pursuing either of these approaches.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Format the <code>what()</code> message on
                demand</strong>, if you feel you really must format the
                message. Formatting an exception error message is typically a
                memory-intensive operation that could potentially throw an
                exception. This is an operation best delayed until after
                stack unwinding has occurred, and presumably, released some
                resources. It's a good idea in this case to protect your
                <code>what()</code> function with a <code>catch(...)</code>
                block so that you have a fallback in case the formatting code
                throws</li>

                <li><strong>Don't worry <i>too</i> much about the
                <code>what()</code> message</strong>. It's nice to have a
                message that a programmer stands a chance of figuring out,
                but you're very unlikely to be able to compose a relevant and
                <i>user</i>-comprehensible error message at the point an
                exception is thrown. Certainly, internationalization is
                beyond the scope of the exception class author. <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/people/peter_dimov.html">Peter Dimov</a> makes an
                excellent argument that the proper use of a
                <code>what()</code> string is to serve as a key into a table
                of error message formatters. Now if only we could get
                standardized <code>what()</code> strings for exceptions
                thrown by the standard library...</li>

                <li><strong>Expose relevant information about the cause of
                the error</strong> in your exception class' public interface.
                A fixation on the <code>what()</code> message is likely to
                mean that you neglect to expose information someone might
                need in order to make a coherent message for users. For
                example, if your exception reports a numeric range error,
                it's important to have the actual numbers involved available
                <i>as numbers</i> in the exception class' public interface
                where error reporting code can do something intelligent with
                them. If you only expose a textual representation of those
                numbers in the <code>what()</code> string, you will make life
                very difficult for programmers who need to do something more
                (e.g. subtraction) with them than dumb output.</li>

                <li><strong>Make your exception class immune to
                double-destruction</strong> if possible. Unfortunately,
                several popular compilers occasionally cause exception
                objects to be destroyed twice. If you can arrange for that to
                be harmless (e.g. by zeroing deleted pointers) your code will
                be more robust.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>What About Programmer Errors?</h3>

              <p>As a developer, if I have violated a precondition of a
              library I'm using, I don't want stack unwinding. What I want is
              a core dump or the equivalent - a way to inspect the state of
              the program at the exact point where the problem was detected.
              That usually means <code>assert()</code> or something like
              it.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it is necessary to have resilient APIs which can
              stand up to nearly any kind of client abuse, but there is
              usually a significant cost to this approach. For example, it
              usually requires that each object used by a client be tracked
              so that it can be checked for validity. If you need that sort
              of protection, it can usually be provided as a layer on top of
              a simpler API. Beware half-measures, though. An API which
              promises resilience against some, but not all abuse is an
              invitation to disaster. Clients will begin to rely on the
              protection and their expectations will grow to cover
              unprotected parts of the interface.</p>

              <p><strong>Note for Windows developers</strong>: unfortunately,
              the native exception-handling used by most Windows compilers
              actually throws an exception when you use
              <code>assert()</code>. Actually, this is true of other
              programmer errors such as segmentation faults and
              divide-by-zero errors. One problem with this is that if you use
              JIT (Just In Time) debugging, there will be collateral
              exception-unwinding before the debugger comes up because
              <code>catch(...)</code> will catch these not-really-C++
              exceptions. Fortunately, there is a simple but little-known
              workaround, which is to use the following incantation:</p>
              <pre>extern "C" void straight_to_debugger(unsigned int, EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)
{
    throw;
}
extern "C" void (*old_translator)(unsigned, EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)
         = _set_se_translator(straight_to_debugger);
</pre>

              <p>This technique doesn't work if the SEH is raised from within
              a catch block (or a function called from within a catch block),
              but it still eliminates the vast majority of JIT-masking
              problems.</p>

              <h3>How should I handle exceptions?</h3>

              <p>Often the best way to deal with exceptions is to not handle
              them at all. If you can let them pass through your code and
              allow destructors to handle cleanup, your code will be
              cleaner.</p>

              <h4>Avoid <code>catch(...)</code> when
              possible</h4>Unfortunately, operating systems other than
              Windows also wind non-C++ "exceptions" (such as thread
              cancellation) into the C++ EH machinery, and there is sometimes
              no workaround corresponding to the
              <code>_set_se_translator</code> hack described above. The
              result is that <code>catch(...)</code> can have the effect of
              making some unexpected system notification at a point where
              recovery is impossible look just like a C++ exception thrown
              from a reasonable place, invalidating the usual safe
              assumptions that destructors and catch blocks have taken valid
              steps to ensure program invariants during unwinding.

              <p>I reluctantly concede this point to Hillel Y. Sims, after
              many long debates in the newsgroups: until all OSes are
              "fixed", if every exception were derived from
              <code>std::exception</code> and everyone substituted
              <code>catch(std::exception&amp;)</code> for
              <code>catch(...)</code>, the world would be a better place.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, <code>catch(...)</code>, is still the most
              appropriate pattern, in spite of bad interactions with
              OS/platform design choices. If you have no idea what kind of
              exception might be thrown and you really <i>must</i> stop
              unwinding it's probably still your best bet. One obvious place
              where this occurs is at language boundaries.</p>
